# Noted

## Purpose

An application that can be used to write and save notes.

When the user opens Note Taker, they are given a landing page with a link to a notes page. Once they click on that page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column as well as an empty template for a new note to be added. When the title and text of a new note are given, a Save icon appears. The user is to click the Save icon once they have completed writing their note and it will save and appear in the lefthand column in addition to the previous notes. If an existing note is clicked on, it will display. When the Write icon is selected on the top of the page, then the user is presented with empty fields to enter in a new note again. This is achieved through npms, middleware, express.js, and node.js on the backend.
